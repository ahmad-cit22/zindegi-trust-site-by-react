                        <p className='my-5'>Our adopted government schools hosted the annual student art show featuring artwork inspired by Sadequain, Frida Kahlo and PostSecret, exercises in pointillism and portraits; mathematical models of a Dream City and an eye-catching installation. A Creatives' Roundtable of leading artists and educators participated in an engaging discussion on the role of the arts in girls’ education. The event attracted more than a 100 visitors including parents, government officials, celebrities, journalists, art educators, bloggers, students from other schools and colleges and the general public. To get a taste of the event, you can watch an archive of the Creatives' Roundtable Discussion here. More coverage of the show here.</p>

                        <p className='my-5'>We launched a campaign called #MoreThanMyMarks to redefine the value of education beyond grades, with the goal of encouraging children and youth to pursue their passions and believe in the possibilities that exist for them outside traditional fields like medicine, engineering or teaching. The initiative featured video and photo stories of students and young mentors who had excelled in non-traditional fields ranging from football and art to theatre and comedy. We got an amazing response from celebrities, influencers and parents who endorsed our message and shared the moment they themselves realized they were more than their marks. Check out the campaign on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram for stories from our featured students, stars like Shahid Afridi, Fahad Mustafa and Mehwish Hayat, as well as people like YOU.</p>

                        <p className='my-5'>2019 was the year children took charge of taking action against Climate Change across the world and students at our government schools were active participants in the movement. We taught a weekly Environment Club period at KPS through which our students learned about environmental pollution and climate change, the benefits of a plant-based lifestyle, how to grow their own food and also did a waste audit. Students from SMB addressed the audience through speech and slogans at the Climate March, making an impassioned call for action against climate change. Students in Shangla during our summer fellowship led a campaign against single-use plastic in a market in rural KP. Write to us to volunteer to teach a workshop to our Environment Clubs!</p>
