                    <p className='text-[13px]'>Despite the school closures during the early months of 2021, we worked closely with the government officials and pushed for changes in policy legislation, which resulted in a number of wins for the teachers as well as students across Pakistan.</p>

                    <p className='mb-5 text-[13px]'>Zindagi Trust has been advocating for an end to corporal punishment for over 8 years. Our efforts resulted in a successful petition in Islamabad High Court in 2018 which led to the suspension of Section 89 of the Pakistan Penal Code and dismissal of the use of corporal punishment on legal grounds. </p>

                        <p className='text-[13px]'>However, this was not the end of our journey; Zindagi Trust then embarked on a campaign to legislate and prohibit all forms of corporal punishment in education institutions. After a sustained effort, the National Assembly of Pakistan unanimously passed the ICT Prohibition of Corporal Punishment Bill in February 2021, which later became part of the legislation in the parliament on 17th November 2021.</p>

                        <p className='text-[13px]'>Bringing an end to corporal punishment is an integral step towards safeguarding children’s rights and we feel pleased to have the support of lawmmakers and government officials on our journey to help create creating safer schools in Pakistan. </p>

                    <p className='text-[13px] my-5'>On June 2nd 2021, the Sindh Government approved a new annual teacher performance evaluation report for government teachers, with the performance evaluation metrics now examining factors directly related to teaching and content mastery. Prior to this, government teachers were annually audited under a generic Annual Confidential Report (ACR) template which was applicable to all civil servants from grade 9 to 16 across all occupations. </p>
                    <p className='text-[13px] my-5'>Zindagi Trust began lobbying for a revamped ACR in 2018, after identifying a significant disconnect between the actual responsibilities of teachers and how their performance was being evaluated in schools. The previous evaluation criteria took into account factors such as typing speed, financial integrity, and observance of security measures, which have no link to the role of a teacher role and their scope. Consequently, this led to lack of accountability for under-performing teachers and failed to highlight exceptional teachers within the educational institutions. </p>

                        <p className='text-[13px]'>With the help of stakeholders from the School Education and Literacy Department (SELD), Zindagi Trust, and government representatives, a specific Performance Evaluation Report (PER) was formulated to address this shortfall. The new rubric incorporates standards such as ‘Classroom Management’, ‘Planning and Instruction’, and ‘Professional Outlook’ and it evaluates teachers on their lesson plans and pedagogical skills to help structure learning around students and make the classrooms more engaging. </p>

As a follow up to this meeting, the Sindh Police collaborated with Zindagi Trust to hold an open discussion with relevant stakeholders regarding the safety of our children. This Child Protection Action Dialogue took place on the 28th of July, 2021 at KPS. </p>
                    <p className='text-[13px] my-5'>At this dialogue, Zindagi Trust, highlighted the organization’s experience and findings in prohibition of corporal punishment as well as promotion of Life Skills Based Education (LSBE) to help protect our children. The attendees included members of the National Commission on the Rights of Child, the Sindh Child Protection Authority, the Social Welfare Department, members of the transgender community, and various civil society organizations.</p>
                    <p className='text-[13px] my-5'>Various topics were covered in the meeting including encouraging children to apply for NADRA registration to help lodge official complaints, identifying physical as well as psychological abuse, curbing street poverty, and increasing representation of the transgender community in the police force.</p>
                    <p className='text-[13px] my-5'>To address all facets of child safety and carry the momentum forward, similar discussions need to be held on building state-level protection mechanisms, particularly child protection centers and rehabilitation facilities.</p>

                        <p className='text-[13px]'>With a quick break for pizza, juice, and ice cream, the students then learned about the art of photography and shared a warm conversation with Shane Anthony from the popular music band, Kashmir.</p>

With schools slated to initially open on the 8th of August, an exponential rise in covid cases delayed re-opening of school campuses until the 6th of September at 50% Attendance. In October 2021, our schools finally opened their gates to welcome our students back at full capacity.</p>

To meet their needs and pique their curiosity once again, Zindagi Trust has conducted various sessions for students on a broad range of topics including robotics, space, activism, environmental responsibility, menstrual hygiene, self care and time management.</p>

                    <p className='text-[13px]'>This year, Zindagi Trust also had the pleasure of inviting a young volunteer, Nikita Mohan, from across the border to share her experiences of growing up in India, with our students over Zoom. What followed was a warm session on cultural exchange and appreciation of ethnic diversity that concluded with our students referring to Nikita as their aapi <span className='font-play italic'>- an elder sister.</span></p>

                        <p className='text-[13px]'>A long-standing critique of Pakistan’s education systems is the lack of emphasis on critical thinking and reasoning skills, which are often eschewed in favor of rote memorization. To address this challenge, this year, Zindagi Trust has designed and introduced a Critical Thinking module with the help of Hina Khalid, our Social Studies and Humanities subject lead. This module is currently being piloted for students of grade 6, in a specially redesigned classroom to develop their cognitive skills and reasoning abilities and improve their critical reading. </p>
