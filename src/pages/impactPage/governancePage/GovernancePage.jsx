              When the government schools were adopted there were little or no
              structures established for administration and no clear policies
              being followed to regulate processes like admissions, promotions,
              attendance and punctuality.
              <br /> <br />
              <br /> Our reform started with strengthening the administration.
              Over the years, an admission policy based on merit and equity has
              been established; SOPs to govern staff attendance, behaviour and
              performance developed and implemented and a performance-based
              student promotion policy introduced.

              At the time of adoption, our schools were missing basic
              facilities, with issues ranging from a lack of safety and security
              to encroachment of the school premises by various elements.
              <br />
              <br />
              <br /> We renovated the school facility to upgrade and provide
              missing facilities like functional bathrooms, safe wiring, clean
              drinking water; constructed modern facilities like computer labs,
              art studios, daycare, an auditorium and playgrounds; and hired
              full-time private security to safeguard the campus.

              Thanks to years of teacher absenteeism and a weak administration,
              student interest was quite low at the beginning of our school
              reform journey, resulting in poor attendance and empty classrooms.
              <br />
              <br />
              <br /> To catalyse the process of change, we introduced
              extra-curricular and co-curricular activities for senior students,
              such as sports, art and a variety of exploratory learning modules.
              We also began to provide counselling to habitually absent students
              and their parents and introduced a minimum of 80% attendance as a
              requirement for promotion to the next grade.

              Like in most government schools, parents were not afforded the
              attention they deserved as primary stakeholders at our schools
              before we stepped in. From the outset, we strived hard to change
              this mindset among the school staff by establishing the practice
              of regular Parent Teacher Meetings every term, an open door policy
              encouraging two-way communication, Parent Orientations for all new
              programs. Today we not only have over 80% attendance at PTMs from
              both fathers and mothers, but also see several parents
              volunteering at and participating in various awareness workshops
              at the school.

              A culture of convenience and complacency had set in the school
              staff, leaving no space for learning and growth. Coupled with low
              expectations from students this led to a compromise in the overall
              quality of learning both within and outside the classroom.
              <br />
              <br />
              <br /> To encourage staff ownership and promote a healthy culture
              of peer learning, we have established teacher-led committees,
              offered regular development opportunities and workshops, as well
              as held vision setting exercises and staff appreciation events.

              Absenteeism, lateness and a practice of missing classes even when
              in school were the norm among the teacher body when we took
              charge. Noticing the dire need for on-ground accountability, we
              established a system of monitoring teachersâ€™ attendance,
              punctuality and discipline with the help of Section Heads and our
              own on-ground management staff. Regular communication with the
              Education Department was established to ensure corrective action
              as well as positive reinforcement where needed.
